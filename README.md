# GitHub App

One of my first mobile app.

It runs with GitHub API to get and store the user you type in the field, and you also can look into it to check the user's repositories.

It uses
 - Babel
 - Eslint
 - Prettier
 - Axios
 - Prop-Types
 - Styled-Components
 - Reactotron
 - React-Navigation 4.0
 - React-Native-Gesture-Handler
